    <p><strong>Ellicott City, Maryland</strong> â€” Eleven Howard County public schools have earned certification or recertification as Green Schools from the Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education. The Green Schools will be recognized at the MAEOE 2018 Youth Summit on May 31 at Sandy Point State Park in Annapolis.</p>
 
    <p>Atholton High School is the newest facility in the Howard County Public School System to earn Green School certification. Bollman Bridge, Guilford and Stevens Forest elementary schools, Harper's Choice Middle School and Marriotts Ridge High School earned their first recertification. Bushy Park, Dayton Oaks, Manor Woods and Northfield elementary schools, and Folly Quarter Middle School achieved their second re-certification as Green Schools.</p>
 
    <p>Two schools, Clarksville and West Friendship elementary schools, were named Sustainable Schools. These schools have earned re-certification four times and have therefore been designated Green Schools for over 16 continuous years. The Sustainable designation is permanent and the schools will remain Green Schools without need to renew certification.</p>
 
    <p>HCPSS has a total of 52 schools that have earned the Maryland Green Schools certification since the program began in 1985. Each certified Green School has demonstrated a continuous effort to integrate sustainable environmental practices, environmental education curricula, professional development opportunities, and community engagement into their daily operations.</p>
 
    <p>The schools engaged in educational opportunities that increase awareness and understanding of environmental relationships that impact public health and the local community. The Green Schools certification signifies that these schools have made a commitment to developing environmental stewards and reducing environmental impact.</p>
