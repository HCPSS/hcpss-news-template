# Making Changes

Use `docker-compose up -d` to see changes. Tool uses a reload feature out of the box to preview changes on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Once changes are all set, navigate to `/headline-news/dist/` and copy the contents of any of the HTML files into SchoolMessenger.

When you are done. Use `docker-compose down --rmi 'all'`.
