  message="
  <p>Howard County middle school students have more in-school opportunities to explore the fine arts than ever before. Over the past several years, HCPSS has launched a quarter-long theatre elective for sixth-grade students; full-year theatre electives for seventh- and eighth-grade students; and a year-long dance elective. Next fall, HCPSS will add another year-long dance elective, enabling students to advance to a higher level and position themselves to take Dance II in high school.</p>"
