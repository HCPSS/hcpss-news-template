    <p>It is National Library Week! We take this opportunity to recognize HCPSS’ outstanding media specialists and the critical role they play in our schools. In addition to helping students to read, research, analyze information, and use digital tools, media specialists support teachers in meeting individual student needs, building relationships, and creating an inclusive school culture. They help to foster a lifelong love of learning and literature appreciation--and they make school libraries an enjoyable place for students to go. Thank you for all you do!</p>"
