    <p>This is National School Breakfast Week, and HCPSS recognizes the Food Services team, which works tirelessly to ensure that all students have access to nutritious, well-balanced meals. While schools have been closed due to COVID, Food Services has continued to operate, providing more than 4 million free meals - including over 1 million breakfasts - to families countywide. As we transition to hybrid instruction, Food Services will serve students in-person while continuing to provide free Grab-and-Go meals through the end of the summer.</p>"
