  message="
  <p>Six years ago, Oakland Mills Middle School Library Media Specialist Jennifer Hamilton decided to try something new. Instead of purchasing books for the OMMS library, she’d have her students manage it, and learn about HCPSS’ book buying standards and rigorous approval process along the way. Since then, the “book buy project” has evolved into a multi-week activity, spanning multiple content areas and allowing students to earn service-learning hours.</p>"
