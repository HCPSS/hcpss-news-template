  <p>It’s National Teacher Appreciation Week! No matter the circumstance, our teachers work hard every day to provide our students with the information, skills and support they need to realize their full potential. Let your child’s teacher know how much you value what they do by sending them an email or a handwritten note, giving them a shout-out on social media, or taking a minute to say “thank you” in your own way.</p>"

        message="
        <p>As part of her junior year English class, Wilde Lake HS student Emmmuella Osei wrote a proposal to establish a mentorship program that would support Black and Brown students pursuing challenging courses and encourage more minorities to enroll in them. Expanding on Wilde Lake High School’s Rise Up Scheduling and Summer Workshop initiatives, Osei’s idea has evolved into a schoolwide program that pairs WLHS students with experience in rigorous courses with Black and Brown WLHS students who are \"rising up\" to an advanced course or who need support in their advanced courses.</p>"
