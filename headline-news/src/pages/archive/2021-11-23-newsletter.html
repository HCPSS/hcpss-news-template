  message="
  <p>This Thanksgiving season, I want to express my sincere appreciation to our parents/guardians, families and community members who partner with our school system to nurture and educate every child and make each one feel valued and accepted. Thank you for your partnership in providing the quality education and opportunities that every child needs and deserves. </p>

  <p>Our school system has navigated many hurdles as the pandemic has lingered on, and throughout these months, I have been awed and heartened by our community&#8217;s spirit of collaboration and unfailing dedication on behalf of our young people. </p>

  <p>As we celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday, I hope you will join me in renewing our commitment to use kindness in the face of anger or hatred, look out for our loved ones, and show grace and empathy in all that we do. I wish everyone a safe and healthy Thanksgiving.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br>
  Michael J. Martirano, Ed.D.<br>
  Superintendent</p>"
