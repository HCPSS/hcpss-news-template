  message="
    <p>Effective Monday, March 1, all <a href=\"https://www.hcpss.org/schools/opening-and-closing-times/\">school start times</a> will be adjusted to begin 20 minutes later than pre-COVID times. Students will not change courses/subjects during the third quarter (Feb. 1-April 14); however, class times and lengths will change.</p>

    <p>Prior to the schedule shift on March 1, your child’s school will share the grade level and/or school schedule with general start and end times. Your child’s teacher(s) will share the specific times that your child will need to join with Google Meet for the synchronous instruction.</p>

    <p>See a <a href=\"https://help.hcpss.org/in-person-students/sample-day\">sample elementary school schedule</a>, comparing in-person and virtual instruction.</p>"
