  message="
  <p>If you ask an HCPSS physical education (PE) teacher what they teach, their answer may surprise you. It’s not just basketball or tennis or golf; it’s a whole range of life skills, like teamwork, sportsmanship, and leadership, that apply on and off the court. PE teachers also work hard to provide students with opportunities to discover activities that they can enjoy for a lifetime. Be sure to let the PE teacher(s) in your life know just how much you appreciate them!</p>"
