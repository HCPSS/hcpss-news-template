  <p>Dear HCPSS Families, </p>

<p>The holiday season offers a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the past year and give thanks. I want to take this moment to express my appreciation to you for your efforts during the first half of this school year to support your children and our school communities. </p>

<p>Many of you go above and beyond to serve on various school committees, support our students through extracurricular activities, and volunteer as coaches, monitors and in many other roles. Each effort, no matter how big or small, plays a role in encouraging our students to succeed and providing an environment for them to learn and grow. I am grateful to be a part of this extraordinary community that values and uplifts one another. </p>

<p>I hope you are able to use the winter break to nourish your mind, body and soul, and spend time with your loved ones. And, while this season brings a lot of joy and opportunities for connection, it brings many other emotions as we grieve the loved ones we have lost or family and friends that we are unable to visit. I want to uplift these <a href=\"https://www.hcpss.org/supports/mental-health-wellness/accessing-resources/\">mental health supports</a> should you or a loved one need to access any resources. </p>

<p>Please take care of yourself over winter break, and I look forward to greeting all of our students, staff and families upon their return in the new year. </p>

<p>Have a healthy, peaceful and rejuvenating holiday season.<br/>
Sincerely,<br>
Michael J. Martirano, Ed.D.<br>
Superintendent </p>"
