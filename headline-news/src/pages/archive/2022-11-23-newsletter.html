  message="
  <p>As we welcome this Thanksgiving season, I want to give thanks for our parents/guardians, families and community members who collaborate with our staff to provide the necessary supports and encouragement to every child to help them succeed. Thank you for all that you do to support their learning at home and model kindness and grace so we can foster a nurturing environment in our schools. </p>

<p>I am grateful to continue serving as your Superintendent, especially after persevering as a community through the hardships of the past several years. With each interaction I have with students, I am reminded of why I am so passionate and dedicated to the success of every child and I feel fortunate to serve in partnership with each of you. </p>

<p>I hope each of you can embrace the joy of this Thanksgiving season and I encourage you to let loved ones know how much you care for them. </p>

<p>Wishing you a healthy, restful and joyful holiday,<br>
Michael J. Martirano, Ed.D.<br>
Superintendent </p>"
