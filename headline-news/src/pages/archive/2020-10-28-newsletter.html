  message="
    <p>HCPSS and the Howard County Autism Society (HCAS) recently hosted a groundbreaking event at Waverly Elementary School for the installation of playground signs that assist students who are nonverbal. By using these signs, students will no longer need to carry their personal communication devices with them, as the wearing of these devices can make it difficult to access the playground equipment easily. The signs, donated by HCAS to eight HCPSS schools, are believed to be the first of their kind at a public elementary school playground in Maryland.</p>"
