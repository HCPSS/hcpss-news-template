  <p>There are many paths HCPSS students can take to approach their high school academic career. Ultimately, all paths lead to a high school diploma, however, one option that gives students a leg up on their journey to college is dual enrollment. For students who plan to attend college—or are even just thinking about it—HCPSS’ JumpStart Dual Enrollment program is a way to earn college credits while still in high school.</p>"
