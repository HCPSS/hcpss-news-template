        <p>HCPSS Superintendent Dr. Michael Martirano reminds the community about the importance of demonstrating civility during interactions with school staff, noting that the “school health team, teachers, bus drivers and other staff members are exceptionally dedicated individuals doing their best and working their hardest to nurture, educate and protect students during extremely challenging circumstances. Quite simply, they are heroes, and they deserve our gratitude and respect at all times, even when they must carry out a protocol or practice that someone doesn’t agree with.” Read the Superintendent’s full statement.</p>"
