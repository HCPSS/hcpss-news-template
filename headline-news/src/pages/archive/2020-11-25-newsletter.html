  message="
  <p>This Thanksgiving season, I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of the parents, guardians and community members who collaborate with our system and staff in providing an inclusive and nurturing learning environment for the children who depend on us for their education and care.</p>

  <p>I am honored and privileged to be Superintendent in a place like Howard County, where people not only speak words of support, but demonstrate their commitment to each and every child through positive action. This year we have faced steep challenges unlike anything we had ever encountered, yet I have been energized and heartened by the remarkable spirit of collaboration and unfailing dedication on behalf of our young people.</p>
  
  <p>As we celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday, I hope you will join me in renewing our commitment to look out for our loved ones, treat each other with kindness, and show grace and empathy in all that we do. I wish everyone a safe and healthy Thanksgiving.</p>
  
  <p>Michael J. Martirano, Ed.D.</p>"
