  <p>HCPSS supports students with a wide range of needs, including those with speech, language, and hearing disorders. Fortunately, we have more than 140 speech-language pathologists (SLPs), who are trained to identify and treat speech and language disorders in children ages birth-21. In addition, we have two educational audiologists and four teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing, who identify, assess, and support students with hearing loss.</p>"
