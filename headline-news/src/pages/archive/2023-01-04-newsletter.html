  message="
  <p>Once a month, community members’ cars line the Oakland Mills High School (OMHS) parking lot to visit the school’s food pantry. Established in 2017 in response to an OMHS student’s independent research project, it has since evolved into a large-scale, year-round operation, bringing together the Howard County Food Bank, Wegmans, as well as various OMHS student groups and staff to collect and distribute non-perishable food items, produce, diapers and wipes to families in need.</p>"
