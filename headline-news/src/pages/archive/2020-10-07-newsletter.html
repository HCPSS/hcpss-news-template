          <p>Dear HCPSS Community,</p>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our community and while the daily number of new cases in Maryland continues to decrease, the virus continues to spread. Students, staff and family members have a special place in my heart, and your safety and well-being mean a great deal to me. I want to continue to remind our community to please, always remember to wear a mask and follow social distancing guidelines. Additional information about precautions can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.howardcountymd.gov/Departments/Health/MM-Alerts-and-Recalls/Prevention\">Howard County Health Department website</a>.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,<br>
