  <p>HCPSS offers 14 half-day and 17 full-day prekindergarten programs for eligible students. HCPSS full-day pre-K programs are inclusive, and students with Individual Education Programs (IEP) are eligible to attend regardless of income, when determined by the IEP team. With registration for 2023-2024 opening on March 13, 2023, parents and guardians of eligible students may find it helpful to learn more about what goes on inside a pre-K classroom and the benefits for those students.
