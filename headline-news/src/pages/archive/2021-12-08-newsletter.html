  <p>Inclusive Schools Week (Dec. 6-10) is a time to reflect on and celebrate HCPSS’ commitment to providing an inclusive school climate and culture where all students can thrive. Starting in early childhood with programs like inclusive prekindergarten, HCPSS educators help students learn to value and appreciate each other’s differences; build healthy relationships based on acceptance, understanding and respect; and prepare them for lifelong success.</p>"
