    <p>HCPSS has developed an extensive School Readiness Checklist to prepare school facilities for the transition to hybrid in-person and concurrent virtual learning. The checklist, which includes 25 individual inspection items, is being used during walk-through inspections to ensure that all preparations are complete before students begin to return on Monday, March 1. Results of the completed inspections are posted on the <a href=\"https://facilities-checklist.hcpss.org/\">Facilities Checklist site</a>.</p>"
