        <p>The original HCPSS calendar had schools and offices closed June 28 for primary elections. However the Maryland Court of Appeals moved the primary elections to July 19 and, in response, the Board of Education approved the following calendar modification:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tuesday, June 28 – Schools and offices open (previously closed)</li>
          <li>Tuesday, July 19 – Schools and offices closed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Due to the calendar modification and other scheduling requirements, several changes were made to the 2022 Summer Programs, including updated start/end times for the BSAP Summer Institute, Innovative Pathways High School and STARTALK Chinese Language Summer Camp.</p>"
