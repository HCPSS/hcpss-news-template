  <p>Dear HCPSS Families,</p>

<p>As we prepare to close our doors in anticipation of the holidays and Winter Break, I want to express how grateful I am for those in our community who embrace the values of our school system by modeling kindness, empathy and respect for our young people. </p>

<p>I appreciate all that you do to support our students – whether you are a community partner who supports and strengthens our school operations or a parent or guardian helping your child in so many ways – each one of our actions plays a monumental role in ensuring we have a strong school system to serve each of the 57,000 young people who enter our school buildings. </p>

<p>During this holiday season, as I have said before, I ask each of you to look out for those in your community who may need some help. Many in our community are struggling to make ends meet and I know that a strength of our community lies in our ability to look out for one another, so I ask that you check in on those around you. </p>

<p>As this year comes to a close, this has been an especially reflective time for me as I feel truly honored to have spent many years as a part of this school system. Wishing each of you a joyous and warm holiday season with your loved ones! </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Michael J. Martirano, Ed.D.<br/>
Superintendent </p>
