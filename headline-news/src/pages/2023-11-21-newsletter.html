  <p>A message to families from HCPSS Superintendent Dr. Michael Martirano:</p>

<p>I want to take a moment to wish all of our families a joyous holiday celebration with their loved ones on Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Many of you had the opportunity to visit our schools during American Education Week last week and I am sure you were delighted to see the wonderful engagement and instruction that is occurring. I am grateful for the dedicated staff we have serving in both our schools and offices who are committed to supporting our students.</p>

<p>As you prepare to celebrate the holiday, I especially want to express my appreciation for those individuals and groups who tend to our children and neighbors with the greatest needs. We know that over 30% of families in our county live in poverty. Some families are living day to day and requiring additional supports to tend to their most basic needs.</p>

<p>I am warmed knowing that so many staff in our schools and offices are working hard daily for children and families who need our help the most. And, we are indebted to the many community partners who are helping to fill the gaps that exist in our schools and community services.</p>

<p>Thank you for being a part of a community that demonstrates compassion and respect for their neighbors. I wish each of you a wonderful and safe Thanksgiving.</p>"
