        message="
        <p>With athletic events slated to begin this week, <a href=\"https://www.hcpss.org/athletics/#fans\">families are reminded</a> that athletic contests are considered extensions of the school day. Behaviors that violate the HCPSS Student Code of Conduct or Board of Education policies are subject to the same disciplinary measures as those that occur during the school day. All children who are in 8th grade or younger must be accompanied by an adult or will be turned away from entry at HCPSS athletic events. In addition, substances such as tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol are prohibited on school grounds. Spectators under the influence of these substances are also not permitted on school grounds.</p>"
